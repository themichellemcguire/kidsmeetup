## Template Feedback

Great job on your templates team; you utilized the legendary django template inheritance! 

Your files used excellent naming convention and were organized neatly. The only opportunity for growth here is to ensure your html/dtl syntax is indented properly. Although this might seem difficult to do in the beginning, I suggest checking out the "beautify" extension available in VS Code. This extension, when utilized, will automatically indent your code.

All in all, exellent job everyone!
