# Project 3:<br>Build a Full-stack Django App as a Team

| Team | Project Name | Reviewer | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**DATX** | **KidsMeetup** | **Daniel Scott**|

### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a
project with a small team.**

You and your teammates together will architect, design, and collaboratively build your app.

With this project you'll be building an exciting full-stack app that uses the **Python**-based **Django Web Framework** and connects to a **PostgreSQL** database.

Optionally, your app may consume a third-party API.

**This project will push you both technically and collaboratively!**

You'll likely find it more challenging to work in a team than by yourself.

You'll likely be working as part of a team in the workplace and **this project will provide you with that important team development experience.**

During this project, your instructors are going to be evaluating **your ability to listen to and respect other opinions; to share and contribute your ideas with the team; and form a consensus and compromise when opinions differ**.

In fact, **your ability to work in a team during this project is more important to your instructors than the project itself**.

### Technical Requirements

Working in a team is going to require more upfront planning to ensure the team is "on the same page"...

#### Your team must:

- **Pitch your project** to the class **first thing Friday** with a [pitch deck][pitch-deck] that includes:
  - The application name.
  - Your team members and their roles.
  - The problem you are going to solve with your app.
  - Check out previous decks: [Meal Ticket](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsBuC-a_AZ1yXJEE-EbptPIdgj1MktiNALyQyhaFfrM/edit#slide=id.p), [Tripio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gvOypLc4VjKqJzdAW68iwh28uGDSH4Sp1KnA5grDo2g/edit#slide=id.p), [Pantry](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvHoN5MNaRembgcoog5p0GtivVCOZSzvfPyeevzy08g/edit), [MovieExpress](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z-ng_6QpUF0pMHOfKNxfRfOLiK-uaXYOyxv94g3kKgI/edit#slide=id.p)

- **Craft thoughtful User Stories together** as a team and manage them in **Trello**.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using Git, GitHub and a standard team work-flow.  Here are some references:
	- [Team Workflow Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg)
	- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
	- [Cheatsheet in Class Repo](../../resources/git_workflow_team_cheatsheet.md)
- **Present the app at the end of the sprint** as a team.

#### Your app must:

- Be a full-stack **Django** application.
- Persist data in **PostreSQL**.
- **Authenticate users using Django's built-in authentication**.
- **Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of resources.**
- Be **deployed online** using **Heroku**.

#### The app may optionally:

- Consume data from a third-party API

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **[pitch deck][pitch-deck], presented as a team to the class Thursday morning**.
- A **working app, built by the entire team**.
- A **team Git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits from
  *every* team member dating back to the *very beginning* of the project.
- **A `README.md` file** with:
	- An introduction of your app along with a screenshot (one is all you need to "introduce" your application).
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used (including outside APIs).
    - A link to your **pitch-deck**.
    - A link to your **Trello** board that contains your **user stories**, **ERD**, and **wireframes**.
    - A link to your **deployed app on Heroku**.
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** your team had to overcome.
    - Description of any **future enhancements** planned.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

1.  **Identify roles** on the team, which may be:

    - **Scrum Master**: the leader of the Agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, etc.) and manager of Trello.
    - **GitHub Manager**: the primary person for managing the repo and GitHub  team workflow (merging pull requests, etc.).
    - **Documenter**: the person in charge of the README, etc.
    - **API Manager**: the person in charge of researching, registering with, etc. APIs.
    - **Designer**: the person in charge of UI design/layout and styling.
    - **Database manager**: this person will be in charge of creating and
      managing the models and their relationships.

    You *don't have to formally fulfill any of the above roles!* They are only listed to provide guidance.
2.  Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use. Definitely 
3.  **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but
    you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified
    effort.
4. Do your best to have only one dev working on a certain file between commits.  This will avoid merge conflicts. This is another reason to separate responsibilities between team members.
5.  **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something
    because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
6. **Pair programming** can be a great way for team members to share knowledge and contribute to the project.
7. Consider following a [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) approach where the team is always developing together on a single computer.  Read [this post](http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/06/01/mob-programming/) for more information.

### Potential Project Ideas

- If you're having a hard-time coming up with an idea, be sure to research potential third-party APIs.
- For this project, we want you to work with your team to build a creative product or one that improves on an existing app.
- One of the best questions to ask yourself is, "Why would I want to use this app?"

---

### Obtaining Assistance from an Instructor

- Although your kind instructors will be available to assist during project time, the amount of assistance you require is expected to be minimal thanks to the fact that you will be collaborating as a team regularly. 

- **All requests for assistance should be slacked to the class channel, not individual instructors**.  This approach will provide the best and quickest response for your team, as well as being helpful to other teams that may be faced with the same issue.

### Unit 3 Assessment

After project presentations, there will be a unit assessment.

The goal of this unit's assessment will be to gauge your ability to develop a minimal full-stack Django application that:

- Renders a list of items.
- Has a form for entering new items.
- Provides for the deletion of an item (bonus).

You will work on the assessment individually, however, the assessment is "open book", so you will have access to all notes, code, lessons, google, etc.

The time period to complete the project assessment will begin shortly after project presentations.  It is anticipated that it will take 45 - 90 minutes to complete.  However, if necessary, you have up to 3 hours to complete the assessment.
